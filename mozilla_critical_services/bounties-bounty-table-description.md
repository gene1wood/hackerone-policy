Our rewards are based on the severity of the issue and the criticality of the service or application. Definitions of the severity levels and examples can be found [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/web-bug-bounty/). 

We have a bug bounty panel whose members decide whether a report is eligible for bounty and the bounty amount for eligible reports. The panel meets on a weekly basis, except for holidays and vacations, to discuss bounty decisions.

Note that some low severity issues are not eligible for monetary awards based on their impact. We will recognize the reporter by thanking them on our H1 page.

Please note these are general guidelines, and reward decisions are up to the discretion of Mozilla.
